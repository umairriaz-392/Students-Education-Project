## About this project
Insights from Student Dataset Analysis
## Gender Distribution
The dataset contains more female students than male students.
## Impact of Parental Education on Student Performance
Students whose parents have a master’s or bachelor’s degree perform better in math, reading, and writing than those whose parents have only a high school education or less.
The highest average scores are from students whose parents have a master’s degree, while the lowest come from students whose parents have some high school education.
Effect of Parental Marital Status on Student Performance
There is no significant impact of parental marital status on students' performance.
However, students from widowed families show slightly higher average scores compared to those from single-parent households.
## Ethnic Group Distribution and Performance
Group E students have the highest performance across math, reading, and writing scores.
Group A students have the lowest scores in all subjects.
The dataset contains an uneven distribution of ethnic groups.
## Impact of Sports on Student Performance
Students who regularly practice sports have the highest academic performance across all subjects.
Students who never engage in sports have lower scores compared to those who play sports sometimes or regularly.
First Child vs. Number of Siblings
Firstborn children tend to have fewer siblings (around 2 on average).
Non-firstborn children generally belong to larger families with more than 2 siblings.
Parental Marital Status Distribution
The majority of students come from married families, while the lowest proportion belongs to widowed families.
Relationship Between Scores
There is a strong positive correlation between math, reading, and writing scores, meaning students who perform well in one subject tend to perform well in others.
Math Score Trends by Ethnic Group
Group E students have the highest math scores, while Group A students have the lowest.
Reading and Writing Score Trends
Group E students perform best in reading and writing, while Group A students have the lowest scores.
## Conclusion
Parental education and sports practice significantly impact student performance.
Ethnic group variations exist in academic performance, with Group E outperforming other groups.
Parental marital status does not have a strong influence on academic success.
Encouraging physical activity and higher parental education levels may contribute to improved student performance.
